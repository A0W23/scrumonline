# Office Fridge
PHP web app for managing a shared fridge in the office or any other sort of foot container. It includes current stock visualization as well as shopping or "food contribution".

## Idea
Traditionally office fridges where used to store everyones private food. However in some companies the fridge, kitchen or event the fruit bowl is public domain. Based on the concept of mutual contribution everyone can bring food or consome what is allready there. However in a geeky way it still makes sense to apply the basic ideas of warehouse management. Meaning current stock or scheduled refills to avoid empty or overflowing storage.
